# Contribute to OpenAE

**OpenAE is a community project.**
We encourage you to engage and contribute. GitHub is used as the collaboration platform with following repositories:

- [openae-io/openae-io](https://github.com/openae-io/openae-io): The [openae.io](https://openae.io) website
- [openae-io/features](https://github.com/openae-io/features): Standardized feature extraction algorithms
- [openae-io/models](https://github.com/openae-io/models): (Pre-)trained models for AE applications using standard features ðŸš§

After the first version `v1.0.0` of feature extraction algorithms is specified, implementations in different programming languages are needed.
The implementations can be part of the `openae-io` GitHub organization or can be hosted externally.

Please contact us [via GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/openae-io/discussions) if you plan to work on a implementation.
