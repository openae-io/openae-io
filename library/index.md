# OpenAE Library

The OpenAE library is an implementation of the OpenAE standards released under the MIT license.
The goal is to provide a single, high-performance implementation that is accessible to researchers using Python or MATLAB while also being suitable for real-time applications even on resource-constrained embedded devices.

## Bindings

The library is written in C++ for best performance and includes bindings for popular programming languages to enable seamless integration across different environments.
