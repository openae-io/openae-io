# Open Standards

The **OpenAE standards** are open, freely accessible standards aimed at promoting consistency, transparency, and collaboration within the Acoustic Emission field.
They enable researchers, engineers, and developers to advance the field by adopting standardized, reproducible methods.

Hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/openae-io, the OpenAE standards foster transparent, community-driven development.
Anyone can contribute by reporting issues, proposing changes and submitting pull requests.
GitHub's version control system ensures that changes are properly tracked.

The current primary focus of the OpenAE is the definition of [feature extraction algorithms](./features/) tailored for data-driven applications.
