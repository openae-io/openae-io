# Open Standards

The **OpenAE standards** are open and community-driven standards for acoustic emission signal processing.
They promote consistency, transparency, and collaboration, helping researchers, engineers, and developers advance the field with standardized, reproducible methods.

Currently, OpenAE focuses on defining [feature extraction algorithms](./features/) for data-driven applications.

## Collaboration

The OpenAE standards are developed transparently on [GitHub](https://github.com/openae-io), where anyone can contribute by reporting issues, proposing changes, and submitting pull requests. GitHubâ€™s version control ensures proper tracking of all modifications.
